*-------------This folder will be used for the Common Directives we develop across the app.------------*
Every Directive should be in its own folder, so that it can be included whenever required and it has all its css/js/html 
files in its particular folder
ex: - For creating a directive for disable key event on any input, we will be following the below syntax
disableKey-|
	   |---disableKey.component.html
	   |---disableKey.component.scss
	   |---disableKey.component.ts
	   |---Any Other File as per requirement
